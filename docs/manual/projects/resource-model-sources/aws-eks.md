To configure the AWS EKS Resource Model Source:

1. In your project, go to "Project Settings" > "Edit Nodes".
2. Click "Add a new Node Source".
3. Select "AWS EKS Clusters" from the list of available node sources.
4. Configure the following settings:

    - **AWS Region**: The AWS region or regions where your EKS clusters are located.
    - **Assume Role ARN**: Optionally specify an IAM Role ARN to assume for retrieving EKS Clusters.
    - **Access Key ID**: The path to your AWS access key in Key Storage.
      authentication.

### Authentication

You can configure AWS credentials at three levels:

1. Resource Model Configuration
2. Plugin Group Properties

### Node Attributes

Each EKS cluster will be represented as a node with the following attributes:

- `gcp-location`: The AWS region/zone of the cluster
- `kubernetes-cluster-endpoint`: The API server endpoint of the cluster
- `kubernetes-use-pod-service-account`: Whether to use pod service account for authentication
- `kubernetes-cloud-provider`: Set to "aws-eks"

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for any error messages.
2. Verify your AWS credentials and permissions.
3. Ensure your EKS cluster is running and accessible.
4. Check network connectivity between Runbook Automation and your AWS resources.
