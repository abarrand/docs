### Add PagerDuty API Key to Key Storage
In the PagerDuty web app:

1. Navigate to **Integrations ->**  **API Access Keys** and click **Create New API Key**.
2. Enter a **Description** that will help you identify the key later on. If you would like it to be read-only, check the **Read-only** option.
3. Click **Create Key**.
4. A unique **API key** will be generated. Copy it to a safe place, as you will not have access to copy this key again. Once it has been copied, click **Close**.
    * If you lose a key you will need to delete it and create a new one.
