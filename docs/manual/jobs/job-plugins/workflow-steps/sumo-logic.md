# Sumo Logic Workflow Steps

:::enterprise
:::

Sumo Logic provides cloud monitoring, log management, Cloud SIEM tools, and real-time insights for web and SaaS based apps.
The **Sumo Logic workflow steps** allows users to automate operational tasks - such as retrieving logs for incident diagnostics - by integrating with a Sumo Logic instance.

There are two Workflow Step plugins for Sumo Logic:
* [Create and Execute Query Search Job](#execute-a-new-query-in-sumo-logic) - Executes a new logs query in Sumo Logic to surface log data in PagerDuty Runbook Automation.
* [Execute a Saved Search Query](#execute-a-saved-query-in-sumo-logic) - Executes an existing, saved logs query in Sumo Logic to surface log data in PagerDuty Runbook Automation.

3. The **Create a Sumo Logic Access Key** window appears.

5. (Optional) In this step defines one or more domains that may use the access key to access Sumo APIs. Enter a domain in the **Allowlisted CORS Domains** field and click Add.
6. The window updates, and displays the domain added. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add additional domains to the allowlist.
7. Click **Create Key** to generate the key.
8. The window displays the generated Access ID and Access Key. Copy both before clicking **Close**. (These will only be shown once.).

3. Select **Sumo Logic / Create and Execute Query Search  Job**
4. In the **Credentials** section, paste in the Sumo Logic Access ID.

<img style='border:1px solid #327af6' src="/assets/img/sumo-add-query.png" />
    :::tip Tip
     It is possible to include variables in the query by making use of [Job Options](/manual/job-options) and [Context Variables](/manual/jobs/job-workflows.md#context-variable-usage).
    For example, if the job uses a log filter to capture the **`_collector`** from a prior step and saved in a variable **`${data.collector}`**, this could be passed into the Query String:
    <br><br><img style='border:1px solid #327af6' src="/assets/img/sumo-use-data-variable.png" />
    :::
7. Select a **Time Range**, such as **`3s`**, **`5m`**, **`1d`**.  This is the relative look-back time for the query. For more details on the time range, see [here](https://help.sumologic.com/05Search/Get-Started-with-Search/Search-Basics/Time-Range-Expressions).
8. [Optionally] Add a name for the **Step Label**.
9. Click **Save** for the Job step.

#### Execute a Saved Query in Sumo Logic

1. Perform steps 1 and 2 above to search for the Sumo Logic Job step plugins.
2. Select **Sumo Logic / Execute a Saved Search Query**
3. In the **Credentials** section, paste in the Sumo Logic Access ID.
4. In the **Search Job ID** field, place in a saved Search query from Sumo Logic.
   :::tip Note
    This is the **SESSION** field for a query in Sumo Logic:
    <img style='border:1px solid #327af6' src="/assets/img/sumo-saved-query-session.png" />
