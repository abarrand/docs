[CVE-2024-45338](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45338) reports an issue in golang.org/x/net:0.20.0, but our usage of it through the `remco` dependency is not affected. This vulnerability primarily impacts servers processing real-time data, causing potential denial of service (DoS). Since `remco` is a CLI tool and not a server, it does not face the same risks. The maintainer of `remco` also confirms this in the commit message for the version we are currently using.

As there have been no updates from the maintainer addressing this CVE, we are unable to upgrade and resolve it at this time. For now, suppressing the warning while continuing to monitor for updates is the recommended approach.
