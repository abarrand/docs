# CVE-2024-24786

## Remco / Google Protobuf vulnerability

::: danger FALSE POSITIVE
 Rundeck and Runbook Automation are not vulnerable to this CVE.
:::

The vulnerability exists in all versions of google.golang.org/protobuf before 1.33.0 and it is used by Remco (not used directly by Rundeck).  Currently, the Rundeck and Runbook Automation Dockerfile that builds Remco uses a specific commit uses the protobuf version 1.32.0.  At the time of this writing there is no update to the Remco build to use the latest the protobuf library.

Protobuf is used by Remco when configured to receive config values from other backends like redis, or secrets from vault.  Rundeck and Runbook Automation products do not use those modes as part of Remco, and therefore would not be vulnerable to this finding.
