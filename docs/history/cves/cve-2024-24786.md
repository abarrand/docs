# CVE-2024-24786

## Remco / Google Protobuf vulnerability

::: danger FALSE POSITIVE
 Rundeck and Runbook Automation are not vulnerable to this CVE.
:::

The vulnerability exists in all versions of google.golang.org/protobuf before 1.33.0 and it is used by `remco` (not used directly by Rundeck).  Currently, the Rundeck and Runbook Automation Dockerfile that builds Remco uses a specific commit, which uses the protobuf version 1.32.0.  

In December 2024 a newer commit patches this version, but a new release version has not been issued.  Version 5.10.0 release will include a fix to address this CVE.


Most importantly, Protobuf is used by Remco when configured to receive config values from other backends like redis, or secrets from vault.  Rundeck and Runbook Automation products do not use those modes as part of Remco, and therefore would not be vulnerable to this finding.
