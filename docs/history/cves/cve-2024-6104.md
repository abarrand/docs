# CVE-2024-6104

## go-retryablehttp can leak basic auth credentials to log files

This issue is tied to the use of `remco` in our Docker images using the vulnerable go-retryablehttp lib. As of current publication, [the most current `remco` version](https://github.com/HeavyHorst/remco) is still using the vulnerable lib. Thus, we cannot resolve this issue by upgrading to the never `remco` version.

## Vulnerability analysis:

This vulnerability exists in a very specific use case scenario as it relates to Rundeck and Process Automation.

### Preconditions:

- A customer is using Hashicorp Consul to create rundeck configurations

- A customer is using  HTTP basic auth credentials to connect to Consul

- Logging of authentication API requests to Consul is enabled

### What may happen

- Unredacted basic auth credentials may get logged

Ex:

Unredacted URL: `https://user:password@example.com`
Redacted URL: `https://user:xxxxx@example.com`
 

## Recommendation
 
Given that a relatively unique setup is required (consul + basic auth) and there is no existing patch for remco at this time this will be listed as a **Known Issue**.  The team will continue to monitor `remco` to check for patched versions.
