# AWS - Identify Unused Security Groups

## Description

This automation job generates a listing of AWS security groups that are not associated with any network interfaces and are therefore eligible for deletion. It checks various AWS services to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Prerequisites

- Turn on "[Runner as Node](/administration/runner/runner-management/node-dispatch.html#runner-as-a-node)" setting on your Runner.  
  - This requires version 5.8.0 or higher.  Adjustments to Node tab may be required for earlier versions.
- AWS CLI installed on the runner node.
- Proper AWS credentials configured on the runner node.

## AWS IAM Permissions

The AWS IAM role or user associated with this job requires the following permissions:

- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`
- `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`
- `elb:DescribeLoadBalancers`
- `elbv2:DescribeLoadBalancers`
- `rds:DescribeDBInstances`
- `elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters`
- `redshift:DescribeClusters`

These permissions should be applied to all resources in the specified region.

                "elbv2:DescribeLoadBalancers",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters",
                "redshift:DescribeClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Job Options

| Option Name | Description | Default Value |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `region` | AWS region to query for security groups | N/A |
| `always-show-results` | Show results even when checking AWS services results in Access Errors | false |

## Job Workflow

1. It uses the AWS CLI to list all security groups in the specified region.
2. The script then checks for security groups associated with:
   - Network interfaces
   - Classic load balancers
   - Application/Network load balancers
   - RDS instances
   - ElastiCache clusters
   - Redshift clusters
3. It compares the list of all security groups against those associated with the above services.
4. The job generates a report of security groups that are not associated with any of these services and are eligible for deletion.

## Output

The job produces a detailed report with the following information:

- List of all security groups in the region
- List of security groups associated with various AWS services
- Security groups that can be safely deleted (not associated with any service)
- Warnings for default security groups (which cannot be deleted)

## Script Details

The job uses a Bash script to perform the following tasks:

1. Fetch all security groups in the specified region
2. Retrieve security groups associated with various AWS services
3. Compare the lists to identify unused security groups
4. Generate a report of security groups eligible for deletion

## Notes

- The job does not actually delete any security groups; it only provides recommendations.
- Default security groups are excluded from the deletion recommendations.
- The script includes error handling and can optionally show the recommendation results even if some AWS API calls result in errors.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running this job:
1. Ensure that the AWS CLI is properly installed on the runner node
2. Verify that the AWS credentials on the runner node have the necessary permissions
3. Check the `always-show-results` option if you want to see partial results in case of API errors
