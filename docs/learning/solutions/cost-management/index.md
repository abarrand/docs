# FinOps (Cost Management)

### Overview

Leveraging Runbook Automation for Cost Management tasks in cloud environments can significantly improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Such tools allow teams to create, schedule, and manage complex workflows across multiple cloud platforms, ensuring consistent execution of cost-saving measures. By automating these tasks, organizations can minimize human error, save time, and maintain better control over their cloud resources. Regular, automated cleanup processes help prevent unnecessary charges from idle or forgotten resources, optimize infrastructure usage, and enforce cost governance policies. Additionally, automation tools often provide role-based access control and audit trails, enhancing security and compliance. This makes them invaluable for organizations looking to streamline their cloud cost management efforts, regardless of the specific cloud provider or infrastructure setup.

### Use Cases

- **Identify and Remove Unused Resources**: Identifying and removing unused resources in cloud solutions saves money by eliminating unnecessary costs associated with idle or forgotten assets that continue to incur charges without providing any value to the organization.
- **Right-size Computing Resources**: Automated resizing of compute resources in cloud solutions optimizes costs by dynamically adjusting capacity to match actual workload demands, ensuring you're not overpaying for underutilized resources or suffering performance issues due to undersized instances.


### Prebuilt Automation 
PagerDuty provides a solution that helps users start automating diagnostics quickly. This Solution consists of **prebuilt Automation Jobs** that show how the use cases above can be implemented in your environment.  (Note: Some of these solutions may exist in other Solution Packages.)
