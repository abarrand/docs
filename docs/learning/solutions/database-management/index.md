# Database Management Solutions

### Overview

Database administrators (DBAs) face numerous challenges related to data security, maintaining high availability, and optimizing performance. They must protect against data breaches and cyber threats while ensuring compliance regulations. Managing backups and disaster recovery plans to prevent data loss is critical, as is minimizing downtime to ensure continuous access to data. DBAs must stay current with evolving technologies and best practices to effectively manage increasingly complex and distributed database environments.

### Use Cases

There are multiple use-cases and benefits to the Database Management solution. Here are a few of the most common examples:

- **Ad-Hoc Backup and Restore:** Specific databases that end-users could run prior to making changes. Particularly helpful for Dev environments to quickly test then reset an environment again.
- **Database Health Check:** Automate the execution of SQL scripts to perform routine health checks on databases, checking for issues like fragmentation, table-space usage, and index performance, or run critical SQL commands to validate they are running efficiently.
- **Schema Change Management:** Automate the execution of schema changes across development, testing, and production environments, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors during deployment.
- **Capacity Planning and Scaling:** Monitor database usage trends and automate the provisioning or scaling of database resources (e.g., adding storage, increasing memory) based on predefined triggers or schedules, or make ad-hoc requests that can be approved through WFA.
