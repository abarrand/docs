      details: Automated diagnostics is a solution provided by integrating PagerDuty's Incident Response and Runbook Automation products. By automating the retrieval of “diagnostic” data during incidents, you can shorten the length of incidents, reduce the number of individuals paged to help with resolution, and gather evidence for fixing the root-cause after the incident.
