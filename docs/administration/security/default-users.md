# Built-In Users/Roles

Rundeck supports a number of user directory configurations.

See [Authentication](/administration/security/authentication.md).

The Rundeck installation process will have defined a set of temporary logins useful during the getting started phase.

- `admin`: Belongs to the "admin" group and is automatically granted the "admin" and "user" role privileges. Password: `admin` Role: `admin`
- `user`: Has access to run commands and jobs but unable to modify job definitions. Password: `user` Role: `user`

These two accounts are configured with the `realm.properties` option [described here](/administration/security/authentication.md#propertyfileloginmodule).

:::warning
It is strongly recommended to configure additional, user specific administration accounts through your preferred Authentication method and secure these two accounts by editing the `realm.properties` file appropriately or turning off the property file login method.

## Default Roles

With the introduction of Rundeck 4.0 there are new built-in User Roles that can be used in ACLs.  

> Note: Roles correspond to a set of actions within the ACL language and are not the same thing as "groups".

Using a least privilege model the new roles enforce specific limitations even if the user assigned the role is provided more access via ACLs.  The Ops Admin and App Admin are inverse roles allowing for separate duties to be assigned for "keeping Rundeck running" and "using Rundeck to Automate"

### Full Admin
The Full Admin role (`admin`) allows the user access to all areas of Rundeck.
